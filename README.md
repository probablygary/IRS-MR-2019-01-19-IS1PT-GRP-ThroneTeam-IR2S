## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

The ability to find a dwelling that is well tailored to your needs can be a challenging task to most tourists, students or working expats. We hypothesize that a fair number of people have not put in sufficient thought into the decision for rentals and come to regret it later. They merely select  a simplistic “Best Option” that is nebulous and founded on unclear terms. This led us to develop the Intelligent Rental Recommendation System to help home seekers make better choices.

With a multitude of websites in the rental industry today ranging from Agoda and Airbnb to PropertyGuru, our Intelligent Rental Recommendation System (IR2S) stands out of the crowd by leveraging on Machine Reasoning Techniques to allow a home seeker to pick the best suited property from the several thousands that are available in the market. The sytem  overcomes these problems by selecting the best properties based on important user attributes which we have gathered through several interviews.

## SECTION 5 : USER GUIDE

`<Github File Link>` : <https://github.com/probablygary/IRS-MR-2019-01-19-IS1PT-GRP-ThroneTeam-IR2S/blob/master/UserGuide/UserManual-IR2S.pdf>

Enter the following in your command prompt/terminal:
- Windows: 
    ```launch.bat clean install```
- Linux/Unix: 
    ```./launch.sh clean install```

The projects will take some time to build for the first time as it will be downloading dependencies to your machine.
If you encounter 'unable to access jarfile target' error, run the launch command one more time.

Once the app has finished building and deployed, open up a web browser and enter localhost:8090. If the build was successful and the app was deployed successfully, you will be able to view the application in your web browser.
